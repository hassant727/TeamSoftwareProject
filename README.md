# About The Project
> PropertyPricer is an ecommerce site, designed for users to buy and sell property. In addition to all the basic 
> features of such a site, we have implemented a price prediction model which we believe gives us a unique edge over 
> other similar sites.
> Thanks to our price prediction model, our users will have access to the best possible information when trying to sell 
> their property. Not only do we give an estimate of the predicted price at time of posting, but we also provide an 
> outline of how that price is expected to change over time based on various market factors.
> In order to take advantage of this service, all our users need to do is post a property for sale. Based on the 
> information provided on the property, our algorithm will determine the current & future estimated prices and display 
> them to you in the form of a chart on your profile page.
